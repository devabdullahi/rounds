-- One public bucket, one folder per student: avatars/<user id>/avatar.jpg. Photos are shown by
-- public URL (no signed-URL round trip on every avatar), so the bucket is public for reads, while
-- writes are limited to the student's own folder. Guests (anonymous sessions) can't upload. The
-- app shrinks photos to a 512px JPEG first; the limits here are the server-side backstop.
-- delete-account removes the folder with the account.
